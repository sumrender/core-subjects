transport layer   => segments
network layer     => packets
data link         => frames

NETWORK LAYER
hop by hop forwarding?
forwarding table?

IP address has 4 parts to it
ex: 192.168.2.30 (except 30, rest is the network address)
                         30 is the device address


Control Plane is used to create routing tables.
It is like graphs
1) static routing: manually 
2) dynamic routing: evolves

protocol in network layer: INTERNET PROTOCOL (IP)

IPv4: 32-bits, 4 words
IPv6: 128-bits

Class of IP addresses
A    => 0.0.0.0    - 127.255.255.255
B    => 128.0.0.0  - 191.255.255.255
C    => 192.0.0.0  - 223.255.255.255
D    => 224.0.0.0  - 239.255.255.255
E    => 240.0.0.0  - 255.255.255.255

Subnets?

Reserved Adresses 
127.0.0.0/8
ex: localhost: 127.0.0.1

Network layers has packets.

Packets:
  Header is of 20 bytes.
  length, identifications, flags, addresses, TTL etc.

IPv6: 2^32 unique combinations
      4 times larger than IPv4
      Hexadecimal
    Cons: Not backward compatible
        : lot of hardware work to shift


Middle Boxes: found in network/transport layer.
1) firewall: 2 types: global internet and your internet network

  Filter out IP packets based on various rules.
  -> Adresses, Modify Packets, Port no., Flags.

  Stateless vs Stateful(more efficient)

2) Network address Translation:
  modify the address


DATA LINK LAYER
sends packets from network layer to physical layer.
DHCP? has pool of ip addresses which it assigns to new devices.

every device will have a data link layer address.
all address first checked in cache then ARP cache. (address resolution protocol)

DLL sends data in frames.
DLL address is MAC address, and it is different for wifi, bluetooth,
even different components of a single computer

PHYSICAL LAYER:
